ATM Machine Backend System – Java Project
The ATM Machine Backend System is a Java-based application that simulates core banking operations such as checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing funds. This project demonstrates my expertise in Java programming and advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, ensuring a structured and scalable backend system.

Key Features:
✔ Account Management: View account balance, deposit funds, and withdraw cash securely.
✔ OOP Principles: Implemented Encapsulation and Inheritance for modular and reusable code.
✔ Exception Handling: Ensures smooth transactions with robust error handling for invalid inputs and insufficient funds.
✔ Code Quality: Follows clean coding practices, ensuring maintainability and readability.
✔ Development Tools: Written using IntelliJ IDEA, leveraging its advanced debugging and code optimization features.

This project highlights my ability to develop backend systems for financial applications, with a strong focus on efficiency, security, and code quality.
